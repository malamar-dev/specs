# Malamar Roadmap

Future enhancements to consider. These are ideas, not commitments.

---

## S3 Backup

S3-compatible automatic backup for the SQLite database and files in `~/.malamar`.

## Import/Export

Export workspaces, tasks, and settings for backup or migration. Import into another Malamar instance.

## Related Tasks Query

Allow agents to query Malamar's API for related tasks in the same workspace.

## In-Browser Push Notifications

Push notifications using the same configurable events as email.

## Clone Workspace

Clone a workspace including settings and agents, starting fresh with no tasks.

## Agent Client Protocol (ACP)

Investigate ACP (https://zed.dev/acp) as an alternative to subprocess CLI calls.

## Community Gallery

Share and discover agent configurations created by the community.
