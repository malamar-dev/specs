# Malamar

> **Malamar lets you combine the strengths of different AI CLIs into autonomous multi-agent workflows, limited only by your creativity.**

## What is Malamar?

Malamar is a self-contained orchestration layer that coordinates multiple AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, OpenCode) into automated multi-agent workflows. Instead of manually switching between tools, you define agents with specific roles (Planner, Implementer, Reviewer, Approver), assign them to your preferred CLIs, and let Malamar run them autonomously until your task is complete.
